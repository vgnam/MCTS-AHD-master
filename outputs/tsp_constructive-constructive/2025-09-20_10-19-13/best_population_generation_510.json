     "algorithm": "The algorithm prioritizes selecting the unvisited node closest to the current node (using the distance matrix) to minimize travel distance, with a fallback to the destination node if no unvisited nodes remain. The `current_node` and `unvisited_nodes` are central inputs, while `destination_node` is only used as a fallback. The code efficiently leverages the `min` function with a lambda to find the nearest neighbor, ensuring greedy optimization.",
