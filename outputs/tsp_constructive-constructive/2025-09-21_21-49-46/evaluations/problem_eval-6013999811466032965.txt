default but dynamically checks if the destination node is sufficiently close (within 0.8 times the average distance to unvisited nodes) to potentially override the farthest neighbor selection, balancing distance and destination prioritization. The dynamic threshold (0.8 Ã— average distance) ensures flexibility, while the farthest neighbor rule provides global optimality.}
