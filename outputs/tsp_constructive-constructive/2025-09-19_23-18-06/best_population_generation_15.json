     "algorithm": "The algorithm uses a greedy approach to select the next node by always choosing the closest unvisited node to the current node, prioritizing minimal incremental distance to minimize the total path length. If no unvisited nodes remain, it returns to the destination node. The function prioritizes `current_node` and `distance_matrix` for decision-making, while `destination_node` is only used as a fallback when all nodes are visited. The structure efficiently leverages Python's `min` and `lambda` for concise implementation.",
