     "algorithm": "The algorithm selects the next node to visit in TSP by balancing immediate proximity (70% weight) and potential path efficiency (30% weight), while penalizing nodes too close to the current node to avoid cycles. The `select_next_node` function evaluates unvisited nodes based on their distance from the current node and their contribution to the overall path length, adjusting scores with a penalty term for very short distances.",
     "thought": "The new algorithm modifies the selection criterion by incorporating a weighted balance between immediate proximity to the current node and the potential to reduce the total path length, using a heuristic that considers both the current step and the overall path efficiency, while also introducing a penalty for revisiting nodes to avoid cycles.",
