     "algorithm": "The algorithm adaptively balances immediate distance, future potential (weighted dynamically by progress), and penalties for reconsidered nodes, prioritizing immediate distances early and future costs later while penalizing late reconsiderations. It uses a normalized progress metric (0 to 1) to adjust the dynamic weight, decreasing future cost influence as the tour progresses. The weighted score combines these factors, with penalties applied only after half the nodes are visited.",
     "thought": "The new algorithm combines No.1's weighted balance between immediate and future distances with No.2's dynamic weight adjustment and penalty mechanism. It adaptively shifts focus from immediate distances to future costs while penalizing reconsidered nodes late in the process, using a normalized progress metric to modulate the dynamic weight.",
