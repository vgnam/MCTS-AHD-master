     "algorithm": "The algorithm implements a nearest-neighbor heuristic for TSP, prioritizing the destination node if it's unvisited but otherwise selecting the closest unvisited node from the current node based on the distance matrix. The function checks if the destination is unvisited first (highest priority), otherwise it iterates through unvisited nodes to find the nearest neighbor (lower priority). The distance matrix and unvisited nodes set are key inputs, while the current and destination nodes guide the selection.",
