     "algorithm": "The algorithm selects the next node by minimizing the ratio of the distance from the current node to the candidate node over the distance from the candidate node to the destination. This prioritizes nodes that are both close to the current position and closer to the destination, balancing proximity and directionality. The function iterates through unvisited nodes, computes the ratio, and selects the node with the smallest ratio, ensuring efficient path progression toward the destination.",
