     "algorithm": "The algorithm selects the next node by minimizing the ratio of the distance from the current node to the candidate node and the distance from the candidate node to the destination. This balances immediate proximity (distance_to_node) and long-term efficiency (distance_to_destination), prioritizing nodes that are both close to the current position and closer to the destination. The function iterates through unvisited nodes, computes the ratio, and selects the node with the smallest ratio.",
