     "algorithm": "The algorithm selects the next node by balancing immediate distance to the current node and long-term distance to the destination, using a dynamic weight factor that prioritizes the latter as the number of remaining unvisited nodes decreases. The weight adjusts the ratio-based selection, favoring closer nodes early and more strategic choices later, with the score calculated as `(distance_to_current ** weight) / (distance_to_destination ** (1.0 / weight))`. The weight increases as remaining nodes decrease, ensuring adaptive path optimization.",
