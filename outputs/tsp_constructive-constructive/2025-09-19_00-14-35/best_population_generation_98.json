     "algorithm": "The algorithm selects the next node by balancing proximity to the current node (60% weight) and distance to the destination (40% weight), prioritizing nearby nodes while slightly favoring those farther from the destination to encourage exploration. The `min` function evaluates nodes using a weighted sum of distances, with `distance_matrix[current_node][node]` (local) weighted higher than `distance_matrix[node][destination_node]` (global). The `destination_node` is returned if no unvisited nodes remain.",
