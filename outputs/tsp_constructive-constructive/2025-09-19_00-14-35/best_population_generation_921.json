     "algorithm": "The algorithm combines immediate distance, connectivity, destination alignment, and potential gain with adaptive weights that prioritize local proximity and connectivity early (high weights) and refine the path based on destination alignment and potential gain later (lower weights). The exploration factor dynamically adjusts weights, favoring multiplicative trade-offs (distance \u00d7 average remaining distances) early and destination-aligned scores later. The critical variables are immediate distance (high early weight), connectivity (moderate), and destination alignment (low early weight).",
     "thought": "The new algorithm combines the multiplicative trade-off of immediate distance and average remaining distances from Algorithm 1 with the dynamic weight balancing of local proximity, connectivity, destination alignment, and potential gain from Algorithms 2-4, while introducing a novel adaptive exploration factor that prioritizes immediate distance and connectivity early, and refines the path based on destination alignment and potential gain later.",
