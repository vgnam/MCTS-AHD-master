importance of nodes closer to the destination. The bias factor increases as more nodes are visited, shifting the focus more toward global optimization. The score is computed as `-current_distance + bias_factor * dest_distance`, but with the bias factor now increasing linearly with the number of unvisited nodes.}

```python
def select_next_node(current_node, destination_node, unvisited_nodes, distance_matrix):
    next_node = None
    best_score = -float('inf')

    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        current_distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        dest_distance = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        bias_factor = (len(unvisited_nodes) + 1) / len(unvisited_nodes)
        score = -current_distance + bias_factor * dest_distance

        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            next_node = node

    return next_node
