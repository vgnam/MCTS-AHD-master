importance of reducing the estimated distance to the destination, while the direct distance ensures practical feasibility. The code processes each unvisited node, computes the weighted sum, and selects the node with the smallest value.}

```python
def select_next_node(current_node, destination_node, unvisited_nodes, distance_matrix):
    next_node = None
    min_total_distance = float('inf')

    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance_to_current = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        estimated_distance_to_destination = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        total_distance = distance_to_current + estimated_distance_to_destination

        if total_distance < min_total_distance:
            min_total_distance = total_distance
            next_node = node

    return next_node
