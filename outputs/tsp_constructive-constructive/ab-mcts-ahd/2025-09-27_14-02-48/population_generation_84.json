The node with the maximum score is chosen as the next node, with a bias towards selecting the destination node when its score is competitive, as seen in the special handling when the destination node is among the unvisited nodes.\n\n## Key Insights from the Code\n\n* The score function prioritizes nodes that are closer to the current node (due to the inverse distance) and farther from the current node in the direction of the destination node.\n* The code checks if the destination node is among the unvisited nodes and updates the next node if its score is higher than the current maximum score, ensuring that the algorithm makes progress towards the destination when possible.\n* The use of `float('-inf')` for initializing `max_score` ensures that any calculated score will be greater, allowing the algorithm to select the first node as the initial next node.\n\n## Code Review\n\nThe given `select_next_node` function implements the described heuristic algorithm. However, the check for `destination_node in unvisited_nodes` followed by the calculation of its score seems redundant because `distance_to_destination` would be 0 (since `distance_matrix[node][node]` is typically 0), making the score infinite or causing a division by zero error. It is likely that the intention was to handle this case differently or that there's an assumption about the distance matrix that isn't explicitly stated. \n\nA more accurate representation of the algorithm might be achieved by directly comparing the distance to the current node and utilizing a more sophisticated method to handle the case when the destination node is among the unvisited nodes. \n\nHere is a slight rewording of the algorithm in under 3 sentences: \nThe algorithm chooses the next node by maximizing the product of the inverse distance to the current node and the distance to the destination, striking a balance between local proximity and global progress. It iterates through unvisited nodes to find the one with the maximum score. The code handles the destination node as a special case when it is among the unvisited nodes.",
